# Story E1.5 — Loading Skeleton Screens

## Status
Ready

## Description

Implement reusable skeleton screen components that display while data is loading. Currently, pages show blank/loading spinners, creating poor perceived performance. Skeleton screens show the actual content layout before data arrives, improving perceived performance by 40-50% and providing visual continuity.

**Problem**: Data loading feels slow even when network is fast. Pages show loading spinners or blank content, users don't know what's loading, perceived performance is poor.

**Solution**: Implement skeleton screens showing content layout and shapes before real data loads. Apply to all data-fetching pages: issues list, Kanban board, sprint view, dashboard. Fade transition from skeleton to actual content.

**Impact**: Improve perceived performance significantly, reduce layout shift (CLS = 0), better user experience, maintain accessibility.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Given a page with React Query data loading, when data is fetching, then skeleton screen displays showing content layout
- [ ] Given skeleton screen, when data finishes loading, then fade transition occurs (smooth 200-300ms)
- [ ] Given skeleton screen, when measuring CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift), then CLS = 0 (no jank)
- [ ] Given skeleton component, when using on Issue list, Kanban board, Sprint view, and Dashboard, then applied to all 4 pages
- [ ] Given accessibility testing, when using screen reader on skeleton, then proper aria labels explain loading state
- [ ] Given mobile view with skeleton screens, then skeleton doesn't cause horizontal scroll
- [ ] Given skeleton screens implementation, when tests run, then ≥80% code coverage

## Scope

### IN (Included)
✅ Reusable SkeletonLoader component
✅ Skeleton screens for Issue list page
✅ Skeleton screens for Kanban board
✅ Skeleton screens for Sprint view
✅ Skeleton screens for Dashboard
✅ Fade transition animation (200-300ms)
✅ Zero layout shift (CLS = 0)
✅ Accessibility support (aria-labels)
✅ Mobile responsive
✅ Unit tests with 80%+ coverage

### OUT (Not Included)
❌ Skeleton screens for admin pages (Phase 2)
❌ Custom animations per component
❌ Theming/dark mode (Phase 3)
❌ Performance metrics reporting

## Complexity
**2** — Medium complexity, straightforward component implementation, mostly CSS work, familiar patterns

## Risks

**Risk: Layout Shift Regression**
- Mitigation: Measure CLS before and after
- Mitigation: Fixed-height skeleton layouts
- Mitigation: Testing for visual regressions

**Risk: Accessibility Issue**
- Mitigation: Proper aria-labels on skeleton
- Mitigation: Screen reader testing
- Mitigation: Keyboard navigation works

**Risk: Animation Performance on Slow Devices**
- Mitigation: Test on mobile devices
- Mitigation: Use GPU-accelerated transitions (opacity)
- Mitigation: Reduce animation if needed

## Effort Estimate

| Task | Time | Owner |
|------|------|-------|
| SkeletonLoader component creation | 1-2 days | Frontend |
| Issue list skeleton screens | 1 day | Frontend |
| Kanban board skeleton screens | 1-2 days | Frontend |
| Sprint view skeleton screens | 1 day | Frontend |
| Dashboard skeleton screens | 1 day | Frontend |
| Animation & transition polish | 1 day | Frontend |
| Testing & performance verification | 2 days | Frontend |
| **Total** | **1-2 weeks** | Frontend |
