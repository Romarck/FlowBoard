# Story E1.4 — Mobile Kanban Optimization

## Status
Draft

## Description

Optimize the Kanban board for mobile devices to provide a usable experience on phones and tablets. Currently, the board renders all columns side-by-side, making it unusable on mobile (horizontal scroll, tiny touch targets, poor UX). This story implements responsive single-column layout, touch-optimized drag-drop, and mobile navigation.

**Problem**: Mobile users (20% of user base) cannot effectively use the Kanban board. Board displays multiple columns that require horizontal scrolling, drag-drop targets are too small for touch input, and navigation is desktop-optimized.

**Solution**: Implement responsive design that:
- Single column layout on small screens (<640px)
- Touch-friendly drag-drop with larger touch targets
- Responsive navigation (hamburger menu, bottom tabs)
- Proper spacing and sizing for mobile usability

**Impact**: Unblock mobile workflow completion, improve mobile user satisfaction, enable Phase 2 work on mobile features.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Given a mobile device (< 640px width), when viewing Kanban board, then single-column layout displays (one column at a time)
- [ ] Given touch input on mobile, when dragging an issue, then touch targets are ≥44px (mobile accessibility standard)
- [ ] Given mobile navigation, when on Kanban board, then hamburger menu shows (desktop nav hidden), bottom tabs visible
- [ ] Given mobile Kanban, when scrolling between columns, then scrolling is smooth with no jank (60fps)
- [ ] Given mobile view, when zooming/rotating device, then layout responds correctly (no horizontal scroll, content reflows)
- [ ] Given testing on iOS and Android, then drag-drop works on both platforms without breaking
- [ ] Given accessibility, when using screen reader on mobile, then navigation is semantic and understandable

## Scope

### IN (Included)
✅ Single-column Kanban layout (<640px breakpoint)
✅ Touch-optimized drag-drop targets (≥44px)
✅ Responsive navigation (hamburger + bottom tabs)
✅ Mobile-specific spacing and sizing
✅ iOS and Android device testing
✅ Landscape/portrait orientation handling
✅ Performance optimization (no jank, 60fps target)
✅ Accessibility maintenance (semantic HTML, screen reader)

### OUT (Not Included)
❌ Desktop redesign (separate effort)
❌ New features for mobile only
❌ Native app development
❌ PWA installation (Phase 2+)
❌ Dark mode (Phase 3)

## Complexity
**4** — Complex responsive design, touch interaction handling, cross-browser testing, multiple breakpoints

## Risks

**Risk: Desktop Experience Breaks with Responsive Changes**
- Mitigation: Parallel testing (desktop + mobile)
- Mitigation: Component-based responsive design
- Mitigation: Comprehensive unit + integration tests
- Mitigation: Desktop-first then mobile enhancements

**Risk: Touch Interactions Don't Work on All Devices**
- Mitigation: Test on real iOS and Android devices
- Mitigation: Use standard touch events (not custom)
- Mitigation: Fallback for touch-unsupported browsers

**Risk: Performance Issues on Older Mobile Devices**
- Mitigation: Measure on mid-range devices (iPhone 11, Pixel 4)
- Mitigation: Optimize bundle size (lazy load if needed)
- Mitigation: Profile performance during development

## Effort Estimate

| Task | Time | Owner |
|------|------|-------|
| Responsive breakpoint implementation | 2-3 days | Frontend |
| Touch-optimized drag-drop | 2-3 days | Frontend |
| Navigation responsive redesign | 1-2 days | Frontend |
| Cross-browser testing (iOS, Android) | 2-3 days | Frontend/QA |
| Performance optimization & polishing | 2-3 days | Frontend |
| **Total** | **2-3 weeks** | Frontend |
